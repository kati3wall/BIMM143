# K means clustering
lets make spme data to try K-means on:

```{r}
# Generate some example data for clustering
tmp <- c(rnorm(30,-3), rnorm(30,3))
x <- cbind(x = tmp, y = rev(tmp))

plot(x)
```


Our tasks
- Use the kmeans() function setting k to 2 and nstart=20

```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers = 2, nstart = 20)
km
```



```{r}
km$cluster
```

Inspect/print the results
Q. How many points are in each cluster? 30
```{r}
km$size
```




Q. What ‘component’ of your result object details
    - cluster size?
    - cluster assignment/membership?
    - cluster center?
 
```{r}
# cluster assignment/ membership
km$cluster
```
 
```{r}
# cluster center
km$centers
```
 

 
 Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and
   add cluster centers as blue points
```{r}
plot(x, col= km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col = "blue", pch = 15)
```
 
 
 
 
 
 Q. Repeat for k=3, which one has the better total SS? k=3, if more groups, smaller spread

```{r}
km3 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 20)
km3
```

```{r}
km3$tot.withinss
```


# Hierarchical clustering

lets try on our x points

```{r}
# First we need to calculate point (dis)similarity
# as the Euclidean distance between observations
dist_matrix <- dist(x)
```


lets look at this distance matrix
```{r}
class(dist_matrix)
```

```{r}
# The hclust() function returns a hierarchical
# clustering model
hc <- hclust(d = dist_matrix)

# the print method is not so useful here
hc
```

lets draw the tree
```{r}
plot(hc)
```

i can 'cut' the tree at any height to give our clusters..
```{r}
#cut at height 6
cutree(hc, h=6)
```

or ask it to cut yielding 'k' clusters

```{r}
#give me 4 clusters please
cutree(hc, k=4)
```


# next part

```{r}
# Step 1. Generate some example data for clustering
x <- rbind(
matrix(rnorm(100, mean=0, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), # c1
matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), # c2
matrix(c(rnorm(50, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), # c3
rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 0.3)), ncol = 2))
colnames(x) <- c("x", "y")
```
```{r}
# Step 2. Plot the data without clustering
plot(x)
```


```{r}
# Step 3. Generate colors for known clusters
# (just so we can compare to hclust results)
col <- as.factor( rep(c("c1","c2","c3"), each=50) )
plot(x, col=col)
```


Q. Use the dist(), hclust(), plot() and cutree()
    functions to return 2 and 3 clusters
```{r}
dist(x)
```
```{r}
# distance matrix
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(d)
plot(hc)
```

```{r}
# to return 2 clusters i could cut at h=2.5 or set k=2
members2 <- cutree(hc, k=2)

# to return 3 clusters i could cut at h=2 or set k=3
members3 <- cutree(hc, k=3)

# lets look at both
members <- cbind(k2=members2, k3=members3)
```

plot
```{r}
plot(x, col = members3, pch=15)
```



Q. How does this compare to your known 'col' groups?



## PCA 
 
Lets make up some data

```{r}
## Initialize a blank 100 row by 10 column matrix
mydata <- matrix(nrow=100, ncol=10)
dim(mydata)

```

```{r}
## Lets label the rows gene1, gene2 etc. to gene100
rownames(mydata) <- paste("gene", 1:100, sep="")
rownames(mydata)
```

```{r}
## Lets label the first 5 columns wt1, wt2, wt3, wt4 and wt5
## and the last 5 ko1, ko2 etc. to ko5 (for "knock-out")
colnames(mydata) <- c( paste("wt", 1:5, sep=""),
paste("ko", 1:5, sep="") )
```

```{r}
## Fill in some fake read counts
for(i in 1:nrow(mydata)) {
wt.values <- rpois(5, lambda=sample(x=10:1000, size=1))
ko.values <- rpois(5, lambda=sample(x=10:1000, size=1))
mydata[i,] <- c(wt.values, ko.values)
}
head(mydata)
```
```{r}
head(t(mydata))
```

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(mydata), scale=TRUE)
pca
```

lets plot our pca plot 
```{r}
## A basic PC1 vs PC2 2-D plot
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2])
```

how well are our pc's capturing our data spread(i,e variance)
```{r}
## Precent variance is often more informative to look at
pca.var <- pca$sdev^2
pca.var.per <- round(pca.var/sum(pca.var)*100, 1)
pca.var.per
```

plot our scree plot


```{r}
barplot(pca.var.per, main="Scree Plot",
xlab="Principal Component", ylab="Percent Variation")
```


```{r}
#colour up pca plot
colvec <- colnames(mydata)
colvec[grep("wt", colvec)] <- "red"
colvec[grep("ko", colvec)] <- "blue"

plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=colvec)
```





## R Ma
rkdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
